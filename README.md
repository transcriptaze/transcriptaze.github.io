### transcriptaze

`transcriptaze` is home to a set of experimental and somewhat _(?)_ oddball audio utilities that explore the interface between Go, WASM and WebAudio:

- [T2B](https://transcriptaze.github.io/T2B.html) identifies the beats of song on YouTube by applying
statistical analysis to _taps_ on a keyboard
- [W2P](https://transcriptaze.github.io/W2P.html) is an in-browser utility to convert an audio file to a PNG


In addition to the web interface, command line implementations of the above, with slightly different feature sets
can be found at:
- [taps2beats](https://github.com/transcriptaze/taps2beats)
- [wav2png](https://github.com/transcriptaze/wav2png)

#### Issues and Feature Requests

Please create an issue in the [transcriptaze](https://github.com/transcriptaze/transcriptaze) _github_ repository.
